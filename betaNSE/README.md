## Instructions to run

- Download chromedriver
- Place it in a folder named `chromedriver`
- Place your chromedriver file in `chromedriver` folder
- Rename the file as per your platform. Example, if you're running `linux` filename should be `linux` if you're running `macOs`, filename should be `darwin`. You can see more platforms in `sys.platform` documentation in python docs.
